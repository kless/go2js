Go2js
=====
Translation compiler from Go to JavaScript.

[Documentation online](http://godoc.org/github.com/tredoe/go2js)

## Installation

	go get github.com/tredoe/go2js

## Status

Inactive | Incomplete

Sorry to not be able to continue with this project for some time, but I have to
work very hard in third projects.

Although I follow being interested in be able to use Go in the browser.

## DOUBT

There are two ways to get an slice in JS:

1. To use a function to calculate the slice value. I'm using this way now:

	https://github.com/tredoe/go2js/blob/054e62f70d94e926812976147cc66a9bccbc370e/jslib/lib.go#L284

	The issue is that it's performance is not good. The solution would be cache
	its value after of to use slice.get(). But then, I would have to add a function
	set() to arrayType (sliceType already has) to know when a value has changed,
	and to add an array to indicate the arrays/slices which are referencing to
	set up, in those variables, a boolean indicating that the slice value has changed.

2. Every time that it is set an array/slice then it is calcualted the slice value.

	https://github.com/tredoe/go2js/blob/6e2abd6e6f4cd1f2facc3f63c877811c2186da4b/jslib/lib.go#L180
	https://github.com/tredoe/go2js/blob/6e2abd6e6f4cd1f2facc3f63c877811c2186da4b/jslib/lib.go#L304

	The issue is that there is to hold the references from where the slice is
	got and to the slices which is referencing. But that references to slices
	variables could change, i.e.:

	arr1 := [...]int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
	arr2 := [...]int{10, 20, 30, 40, 50}

	slice1 := arr1[1:] // JS: arr1 has reference to slice1
	slice2 := arr2[2:] // JS: arr2 has reference to slice2

	// JS: arr2 add reference to slice1, but the anterior reference should be removed
	slice1 = arr2[2:]

	So it can becomes to be complex.

Ideas? Thoughts?

## No implemented

+ The multiple assignment has different order of preference than in JS
 (functionInverse in "testdata/func.go" fails due this issue).
+ Evaluation of constants.
+ Shadow variables in JS.
+ Goroutines.
+ Types int64 and complex.
